What's New in Extra Clang Tools 10.0.0?
=======================================

Some of the major new features and improvements to Extra Clang Tools are listed
here. Generic improvements to Extra Clang Tools as a whole or to its underlying
infrastructure are described first, followed by tool-specific sections.

Major New Features
------------------

...

Improvements to clangd
----------------------

The improvements are...

Improvements to clang-doc
-------------------------

- :doc:`clang-doc <clang-doc>` now generates documentation in HTML format.

Improvements to clang-query
---------------------------

The improvements are...

Improvements to clang-rename
----------------------------

The improvements are...

Improvements to clang-tidy
--------------------------

- New :doc:`abseil-duration-addition
  <clang-tidy/checks/abseil-duration-addition>` check.

- New :doc:`bugprone-dynamic-static-initializers
  <clang-tidy/checks/bugprone-dynamic-static-initializers>` check.

  Finds instances where variables with static storage are initialized
  dynamically in header files.

- New :doc:`fpga-id-dependent-backward-branch
  <clang-tidy/checks/fpga-id-dependent-backward-branch>` check.

  Finds ID-dependent variables and fields that are used within loops.

- New :doc:`fpga-kernel-name-restriction
  <clang-tidy/checks/fpga-kernel-name-restriction>` check.

  Checks for cases where the kernel source file is named "kernel.cl",
  "Verilog.cl", or "VHDL.cl".

- New :doc:`fpga-unroll-loops
  <clang-tidy/checks/fpga-unroll-loops>` check.

  Checks for inner loops that aren't unrolled. Unrolling these loops could improve
  the performance of OpenCL kernels. Also checks for fully unrolled loops with a
  large number of iterations or unknown bounds. These loops cannot be fully 
  unrolled, and should be partially unrolled.

- New :doc:`linuxkernel-must-use-errs
  <clang-tidy/checks/linuxkernel-must-use-errs>` check.

  Checks Linux kernel code to see if it uses the results from the functions in
  ``linux/err.h``.

- New :doc:`google-upgrade-googletest-case
  <clang-tidy/checks/google-upgrade-googletest-case>` check.

  Finds uses of deprecated Googletest APIs with names containing ``case`` and
  replaces them with equivalent APIs with ``suite``.

- New :doc:`llvm-prefer-register-over-unsigned
  <clang-tidy/checks/llvm-prefer-register-over-unsigned>` check.

  Finds historical use of ``unsigned`` to hold vregs and physregs and rewrites
  them to use ``Register``

- New :doc:`OpenCL-recursion-not-supported
  <clang-tidy/checks/OpenCL-recursion-not-supported>` check.

  Checks for cases where a function call is recursive. This is restricted by 
  OpenCL.


Improvements to include-fixer

The improvements are...

Improvements to clang-include-fixer
-----------------------------------

The improvements are...

Improvements to modularize
--------------------------

The improvements are...

Improvements to pp-trace

The improvements are...

Clang-tidy visual studio plugin
-------------------------------

The clang-tidy-vs plugin has been removed from clang, as
it's no longer maintained. Users should migrate to
`Clang Power Tools <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=caphyon.ClangPowerTools>`_
instead.
